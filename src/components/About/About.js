                    <p style={{textAlign:'right'}}>Way back when a work trip took me to Mangalore Port, which put a spell on me; the fish there tasted so good and fresh, and so I began to ship them to Bengaluru for my home and, later, to my friends here in Bengaluru. Regularly for a long while friends would approach me asking for seafood from different states and every week friends of friends would get involved until the capacity of our living room wasn't up to the demand. I began to look for a solution and it was from this the idea of my own e-shop D2C first came up.<br/><br/>

                    <p>For many years I worked for distributors and retailers as a CA. Even after so many years I still enjoy marketing, and sales is my "guilty pleasure". I also now have the chance to involve myself with operations in SEA BASKET. We would like to enhance your experience, to choose to buy seafood with us.<br/><br/>
